# PropellerSourceOpenFOAM
Development of propeller source term model for OpenFoam based on BEM theory

Computational fluid mechanics (or CFD) programs make it possible to obtain detailed solutions to complex fluid mechanics problems. As a general rule, the more complex the problem, the higher the computational cost required. Fortunately, there are multiple methods to reduce the associated computational cost without incurring prohibitive penalties in the quality of the results. One of these methods is the resolution of rotors and propellers using the blade element theory (BET) method coupled with the finite volume resolution of the rest of the fluid field: thus, it is possible to solve problems with a strong interaction between the propulsive system and the aerodynamic performances of an aircraft with a contained cost. OpenFOAM, the open source CFD program, currently has a BET method implemented, although highly limited. In this work, the author implements the BET method in OpenFOAM providing it with many useful extra functionalities: interpolation in Reynolds number, Mach and angle of attack, extrapolation in angle of attack, multiple meshing methods of the BET disk or resolution, among others. In addition, a modular implementation is developed, laying a foundation for future development and improvement of this method.
